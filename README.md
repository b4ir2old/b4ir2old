- 👋 Hi, I’m @b4ir2old also know as Joel
- 👀 I’m interested in python and C++ because I teach those courses at a community college
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and C++ even thought I have been teaching both for years, with computer languages you never stop learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing special a the moment. I really became interested in Github when my college got hit by ransomware this spring 
and we lost so much information. I don't want to go thru rebuilding from the ground up again.
- 📫 How to reach me my school email is joel.moore@cpcc.edu
